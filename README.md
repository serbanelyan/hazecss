## Documentation

Haze's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is publicly hosted at [HazeCSS](https://hazecss.com/). The docs may also be run locally. Previous versions (together with their documentation) will be available as well. More details will be made public on the next major release.

## Versioning

We strive to adhere to the [Semantic Versioning guidelined](https://semver.org/) whenever possible. We might not be able to stick to these rules consistently, but we're doing our best. For details on each Haze release, make sure to check the [Changelog](https://github.com/serbanelyan/hazecss/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
